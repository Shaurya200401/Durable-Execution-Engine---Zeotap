# Prompts Used

## Initial Planning
- "Create a task list for building a Durable Execution Engine in Java."
- "Design a simple persistence layer schema for workflow steps using SQLite."

## Implementation
- "Generate a Java class `DurableContext` that executes a Callable and saves result to SQLite."
- "How to use Jackson to serialize generic objects in Java?"
- "Implement a thread-safe SQLite helper class in Java."
- "Create an example Java workflow using CompletableFuture for parallel steps."

## Debugging & Refinement
- "How to handle SQLite busy exceptions in Java JDBC?" (Handled via synchronized methods)
- "Best way to simulate a process crash in Java." (System.exit)

## Bonus Challenge: Automatic Sequence ID
- "How to get the caller's class and method name in Java using stack trace?"
- "Implement a method to generate a unique step ID based on stack trace."
- "Create an overloaded method for `step` that assumes the ID."
- "Create a Java class `AutoIdWorkflow` to test automatic ID generation."
- "Verify that the automatic ID generation is deterministic across runs."
